# cisc124-assignments
These are three assignments for Intro to Computing Science II. A course focused on Java and OOP.

## NHL Simulator
To implement a simulation of an ice hockey season in one of the divisions of the NHL (National Hockey League) that would potentially allow a given team to estimate its chances of making it to the playoffs. The simulation will run as a text-based, interactive, and menu driven program that will comply with a set of rules as specified below.
#### Learnings
* Practiced designing and coding simple classes and methodsusing loops, conditionals and console I/O in the Java language.
* Exposure to object-oriented techniques to solve computational problems

## HPO Explorer
To implement a simple software prototype tool, named HPOExplorer, to explore a biomedical ontology of human disease description terms, stored in a structured text file, in response to a simple type of queries about these terms. HPOExplorer receives these queries from, and produces results to, formatted text files.
#### Learnings
* Implemented simple algorithms to parse and traverse a set of structured data
* Practiced applying the file I/O and exception classes in the Java API

## Transit Optimizer
To implement a small and simple prototype tool, named MTOptimizer, to explorerough fleet size optimizations in the hourly deployment of the vehicles used in the different public transportation modalities (i.e., buses, subways, trains) at the city of Toronto. The tool takes as input: 1) a representative sample of a typical workday passenger ridership (approximately 10% of the true number of daily passengers) for all means of transportation, 2) fleet descriptions and vehicle properties for each means of transportation. The tool outputs hourly estimates of the optimal number of vehicles, for each means of transportation, that should be in operation, in a 24-hour period, to satisfy the projected demand indicated by the processed sample.
#### Learnings
* Design and implement small class hierarchies, and use interfaces to delineate those classes.
* Allocating attributes and behaviours (i.e., methods) in class hierarchies that facilitate the reusing of programming code and the instantiation of objects that effectively encapsulate data and functionality in support of applications involving multiple actors
